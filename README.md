# Activities.iml
Software that helps user find some activites to do during their day
Who?- This code is made to help indecisive people (like myself) 
What?- give users an idea of some potential activities to do throughout their day
Where/when?- I envision this software being used at the beginning of the user's day after they check the weather for the day they can input the appropriate factors that may affect what they do for the day
How?- right now the code only asks the subject what their surroundings are like I plan to add more options for example asking how much money the subject has available or is willing to spend for the day.
Why?- I feel that is software when they have absolutely no plans and are willing to let chance and some personal factors decide what they do with their day
